# SPARQL

Explore the world of GraphDB and SPARQL using the Pizza ontology.

## Data

Using the pizza ontology as created [here](https://protege.stanford.edu/ontologies/pizza/pizza.owl). A `.ttl` version is available [here](https://github.com/avicomp/ont-api/blob/master/src/test/resources/ontapi/pizza.ttl).

## Plan of Attack

- [X] Create repository.
- [X] Create version 1 of documentation.
- [X] 2 queries on classes or properties.
- [X] 5 queries on individuals.
- [X] 3 queries use more than one concept in the knowledge base and use more than once FILTER.
- [X] 3 queries that demonstrate the reasoning in the database, meaning that when reasoning is on there are more results extracted, compared to when reasoning is off.
- [X] 2 queries use set operations (UNION, MINUS, ‘OPTIONAL’, ‘.).
- [X] 2 queries use assigning variables functions (BIND, BIND IF, VALUES).
- [X] 2 queries use aggregating functions (COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG, GROUP BY).
- [ ] Finish documentation (~47 words explaining each query).
